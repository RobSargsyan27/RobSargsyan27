## 👨‍💻 About Me
Hi, I'm Robert, a backend developer specializing in the MERN stack. I build efficient, scalable systems using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, with a bit of React for front-end components. My focus is on creating robust RESTful APIs, ensuring smooth data flow, and implementing best practices like CI/CD and unit testing. 

I work closely with teams to understand business needs and deliver solutions that meet them. In addition to backend development, I maintain clear, up-to-date API documentation to ensure smooth collaboration across teams.
